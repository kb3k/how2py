# **how2py: Web Scraping and Data Simulation**

This repository contains code to perform basic web scraping and simulate a random dataset.

## **Project Structure**

The repository includes the following components:

*   **Jupyter Notebooks**: Contains the Python code for both web scraping and data simulation. The entire project is written in Jupyter Notebook.
*   **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and usage.
*   **LICENSE**: The project is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for free use and modification.
*   **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## **Usage Examples**

The Jupyter Notebooks provide executable examples of:

*   How to scrape data from a website using Python libraries.
*   How to generate a random dataset using Python.

To use the code, simply open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment, and follow the instructions in each notebook.

## **Dependencies**

To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries:

*   `requests` or `Beautiful Soup` (for web scraping)
*   `NumPy` or `Pandas` (for data simulation)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 numpy pandas
```

## **Future Development**

Possible future developments include:

*   Expanding the web scraping capabilities to handle more complex websites.
*   Implementing different data simulation methods.
*   Adding data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
*   Integrating the data with AI/ML models.
